## Technological Developments Enabling Improved Cryo-Laser PFIB Workflows

Since 2019, several technological developments have been commercialized which enable significant improvements to Cryo-Laser PFIB workflows.

- **Cryo-stage improvements:** More recent cryo-stage designs allow for 360&deg; rotation, where the top plate of the cryo-stage rotates freely. With full rotation capability, PFIB polishing could be done on cross-sections after UPL ablation without venting the chamber to manually rotate the sample. This also prevents ice contamination from forming during the vent cycle.

- **Laser improvements:** Commercial Laser PFIBs (Helios 5 Laser platform) have higher laser power output (more pulse energy) that could further improve throughput or enable deeper UPL cross-sectioning in harder or thicker materials and systems.

- **Multiple plasma ion species:** In recent years, Thermo Fisher Scientific released a multiple ion species PFIB (Helios Hydra) which can generate Xe{sup}`+`, Ar{sup}`+`, O{sup}`+`, or N{sup}`+` ions, where other ion species could result in improved cross-section quality. Higher PFIB beam currents are also available, which could improve throughput to enable more practical PFIB polishing of larger areas.

- **Automation capabilites:** AutoScript, a Python based API for microscope automation, has been developed by Thermo Fisher Scientific which allow users to build custom automation solutions. For example, the UPL cross-sectioning and subsequent PFIB polishing and SEM imaging could be fully automated via AutoScript. Customizable 3D workflows could also be built and could include analytical steps such as EDS mapping.
