Accessing and preparing representative cross-sections of complex, often beam-sensitive, heterogeneous systems for high-resolution electron microscopy presents a significant bottleneck for materials analysis. These challenges are compounded when multiphase systems (e.g., batteries) must be disassembled to enable nanoscale characterization, and critical interfacial information is likely to be lost. In this work, we detail the advanced methodology employing cryogenic ultra-short pulsed laser ablation in conjunction with plasma focused ion beam milling (cryo-Laser PFIB) that we developed in 2019 to overcome these challenges. While our previous work focused on outcomes of our efforts, here we will discuss in-depth the principles and optimization of this approach for obtaining 2D-area and 3D-volume characterization, combining rapid material removal by laser and precision PFIB polishing milling under cryogenic conditions. This combined technique minimizes artifacts that otherwise may result from sources like mechanical or thermal processing, preserving the delicate microstructures and interfaces that may be inherent in heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, we highlight recent technological developments in instrumentation and workflows that significantly enhance the capabilities and broaden the applicability of cryo-Laser PFIB beyond specific material types. By showcasing the potential of this evolved technique, we highlight it’s growing importance as a powerful tool for characterizing internal architectures and understanding structure-property relationships across a wide range of scientific and technological domains.
